      <h2>NSD's Star Clown: Szynek</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s talk about <strong>Szynek</strong>, one of NSD's loudest members — and also one of the most paranoid and fragile. 
        He claims he <strong>"got fedded"</strong>, talks about getting killed in a raid, and constantly begs for help in Telegram chats.
      </p>

      <div class="screenshot">
        <img src="media/pic1.png" alt="Screenshot 1" />
        <img src="media/pic2.png" alt="Screenshot 2" />
      </div>

      <p>He says things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Recruitment is stopped”</li>
        <li>“I am cooked”</li>
        <li>“Help me goys fr”</li>
        <li>“Imma just get killed in a raid”</li>
        <li>“I don’t want to leave my family”</li>
        <li>“It’s hard because I am not 18 yet”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is not a hardened revolutionary — just a scared kid caught up in an internet fantasy. 
        He talks like he’s in a war movie, but in reality, he’s sitting in his room shaking over imaginary raids. 
        He admits he’s <strong>underage</strong>, claims to be hunted by authorities, and still thinks he’s in some kind of resistance movement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even funnier, he says:
        <br /><br />
        <em>“Poland is EU, open borders to anywhere in Europe.”</em>
        <br /><br />
        Like running across the EU is going to save him from his own delusions. No, Szynek — this isn’t a spy movie, it’s just Discord LARPing.
      </p>

      <p>
        NSD is full of people like this — scared, unstable, and disconnected from reality. 
        They don’t need to be feared — they need to be exposed.
