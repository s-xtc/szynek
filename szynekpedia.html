      <h2>Szynek's clown skillz we documented</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s talk about <strong>Szynek</strong>, one of NSD's loudest members — and also one of the most paranoid and fragile. 
        He claims he <strong>"got fedded"</strong>, talks about getting killed in a raid, and constantly begs for help in Telegram chats.
      </p>

      <div class="screenshot">
        <img src="media/pic1.png" alt="Screenshot 1" />
        <img src="media/pic2.png" alt="Screenshot 2" />
      </div>

      <p>He says things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Recruitment is stopped”</li>
        <li>“I am cooked”</li>
        <li>“Help me goys fr”</li>
        <li>“Imma just get killed in a raid”</li>
        <li>“I don’t want to leave my family”</li>
        <li>“It’s hard because I am not 18 yet”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is not a hardened revolutionary — just a scared kid caught up in an internet fantasy. 
        He talks like he’s in a war movie, but in reality, he’s sitting in his room shaking over imaginary raids. 
        He admits he’s <strong>underage</strong>, claims to be hunted by authorities, and still thinks he’s in some kind of resistance movement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even funnier, he says:
        <br /><br />
        <em>“Poland is EU, open borders to anywhere in Europe.”</em>
        <br /><br />
        Like running across the EU is going to save him from his own delusions. No, Szynek — this isn’t a spy movie, it’s just Discord LARPing.
      </p>

      <p>
        NSD is full of people like this — scared, unstable, and disconnected from reality. 
        They don’t need to be feared — they need to be exposed.

  <h2>Szynek's Historical Illiteracy: “Hitler Didn't Kill Poles”</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most baffling things Szynek claims is that <strong>“Hitler didn’t kill Poles.”</strong> 
    This statement isn’t just wrong — it’s outright historical denial.
  </p>

  <p>
    During World War II, <strong>Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland</strong>, unleashing one of the most brutal regimes in modern history. 
    The Nazis viewed <strong>Poles</strong> — especially the ethnic Catholic majority — as <em>"subhuman"</em> (Untermenschen) 
    and deliberately targeted them for extermination, enslavement, and forced displacement.
  </p>

  <p>
    From 1939 to 1945, the German occupation of Poland resulted in the deaths of 
    <strong>at least 1.8 to 2.77 million non-Jewish Polish civilians</strong>, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Political leaders</li>
    <li>Teachers</li>
    <li>Priests</li>
    <li>Artists</li>
    <li>Intellectuals</li>
    <li>Ordinary civilians caught in mass executions</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    “As part of the policy to destroy the Polish resistance, the Germans killed many of the nation’s political, religious, and intellectual leaders... and confined Poles in dozens of prisons and concentration and forced labor camps, where many perished.”<br>
    — <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/2000926-Poles.pdf" target="_blank">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Even children weren’t spared. The Nazis <strong>kidnapped Polish children</strong> deemed “racially valuable” and forcibly Germanized them. 
    Others were sent to brutal labor camps where many died.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>In short:</strong><br>
    - Hitler’s regime killed <strong>millions of Poles</strong><br>
    - Being Polish was enough to get you arrested, deported, or executed<br>
    - Saying “Hitler didn’t kill Poles” is not only ignorant — it’s a disgrace to history
