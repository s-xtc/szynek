  <h1>Exposing NSD: A Clown Show of Lies and LARPing</h1>

  <p>Let’s talk about <strong>NSD (National Socialist Division)</strong> — a group that tries to act like they’re some underground resistance, but in reality, they’re just a bunch of keyboard warriors living in a fantasy world. Here’s a breakdown of their biggest lies and delusions:</p>

  <h2>1. “We don’t record actions for safety”</h2>
  <p><strong>What actions?</strong> You guys don’t do anything. You sit behind your screens, type edgy messages, and pretend you're some elite revolutionary group. There are <strong>no actions</strong> because you don’t have the guts to actually do anything. The “no recording” excuse is just a cover for the fact that nothing ever happens. Keyboard warrior energy at its peak.</p>

  <h2>2. The lie about “David getting fedded”</h2>
  <p>One of NSD’s so-called leaders claims that a guy named David got arrested by feds — or as they like to say, “got fedded.” But here’s the catch: there’s <strong>zero proof.</strong> The source? He says he "searched his name in the system." What system? Google? FBI database? Lies on top of lies, trying to make themselves sound important.</p>

  <h2>3. Fake story about mosque shooting</h2>
  <p>Another bold claim: someone from NSD supposedly got arrested for <strong>planning a mosque shooting</strong> — and was conveniently labeled schizophrenic to make the story more dramatic. This is pure fabrication. There’s <strong>no record, no arrest, no news — nothing.</strong> They just invent fake martyrs to fuel their fantasy narrative.</p>

  <h2>4. Torture, ZOG, and brainwashing? Seriously?</h2>
  <p>This might be the most pathetic claim of all. According to NSD, David came back after being "tortured and brainwashed by the ZOG" (Zionist Occupied Government). Apparently, they think he forgot everything because of some elite-level mind control. That’s not edgy, that’s <strong>delusional.</strong> These people live in a conspiracy-fueled cartoon world.</p>

  <h2>Final message</h2>
  <p><strong>NSD is a joke.</strong> They lie to look dangerous, but they’re just LARPers trying to scare kids online. Don’t fall for their fake stories and psychotic roleplay. The truth? They’re nothing. And it’s time people see them for what they really are: <strong>frauds.</strong></p>
